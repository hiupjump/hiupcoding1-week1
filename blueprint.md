# AdSense-Ready Dinner Menu Recommendation Website - Modern UI Revamp

## Project Goal

To transform the website's layout and aesthetics into a more modern, sophisticated, and youth-friendly design, addressing feedback that the current layout is awkward. The aim is to create a visually appealing and intuitive user experience.

## Key Design Principles for Revamp

*   **Clean and Minimalist**: Reduce visual clutter, focus on essential elements.
*   **Vibrant and Inviting Color Palette**: Use a modern color scheme that is appealing.
*   **Improved Typography**: Select fonts that are legible and contribute to a contemporary feel.
*   **Enhanced Interactivity**: Subtle hover effects, smooth transitions.
*   **Responsive and Adaptive**: Ensure the design looks great on all screen sizes.
*   **Better Spacing and Visual Hierarchy**: Optimize margins, paddings, and element sizing for better balance.

## Plan

1.  **Update `style.css`**:
    *   **Color Palette**: Define a fresh, modern color palette using CSS variables (`--primary-color`, `--secondary-color`, `--accent-color`, etc.) for both light and dark modes.
    *   **Typography**: Change `font-family` to a more modern, sans-serif font. Adjust `font-size`, `line-height`, and `font-weight` for better readability and visual hierarchy.
    *   **General Layout & Spacing**: Refine `body` and `main-content` layout. Increase overall spacing and padding for a cleaner look.
    *   **Container**: Update `container` styles, possibly with softer shadows, borders, or a slightly different background.
    *   **Buttons**: Redesign `recommendBtn` and `category-btn` for a more modern, perhaps slightly rounded or gradient-filled, appearance with improved hover effects.
    *   **Header & Footer**: Make them sleeker, perhaps with transparent or semi-transparent backgrounds that adapt to dark mode.
    *   **Dark Mode Toggle**: Ensure it seamlessly blends with the new design.
    *   **Responsive Adjustments**: Review and refine media queries to ensure the new design scales well.

2.  **Review HTML Files**:
    *   Check `index.html`, `about.html`, `contact.html`, `privacy.html` for any minor structural adjustments needed to fully leverage the new CSS, although major changes are not anticipated.

3.  **Commit and Push**: Upload all design changes to the GitHub repository.
