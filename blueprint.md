# AdSense-Ready Dinner Menu Recommendation Website

## Project Goal

To enhance the website to meet Google AdSense's "high-quality site" standards, increasing the likelihood of AdSense approval. This involves improving content, user experience, and trustworthiness.

## Key Improvements based on AdSense Guidelines

*   **Unique & Valuable Content**: Expand the variety and quality of menu recommendations.
*   **User-Centric Design**: Implement a clear navigation structure and ensure the site is easy to use.
*   **Trust & Transparency**: Add essential pages like "About Us," "Contact Us," and a "Privacy Policy."

## Plan

1.  **Create Essential Pages**:
    *   `about.html`: A page explaining the purpose and mission of the site.
    *   `contact.html`: A page with contact information or a contact form.
    *   `privacy.html`: A page detailing the site's privacy policy.

2.  **Improve Site Structure**:
    *   Modify `index.html` to include a header with a navigation bar linking to Home, About, and Contact pages.
    *   Add a consistent footer to all pages with copyright information and links to About, Contact, and Privacy Policy.
    *   Apply the same header/footer structure to `about.html`, `contact.html`, and `privacy.html`.

3.  **Enhance Content**:
    *   Significantly expand the menu lists in `main.js` to provide more diverse and interesting recommendations.

4.  **SEO & Metadata**:
    *   Add descriptive `<meta>` tags (description, keywords) to all HTML files to improve search engine visibility.

5.  **Styling**:
    *   Update `style.css` to ensure the new navigation, footer, and pages are styled consistently with the existing design, including dark mode.

6.  **Code Upload**:
    *   Commit and push all changes to the GitHub repository.
