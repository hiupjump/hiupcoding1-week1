# AdSense-Ready Dinner Menu Recommendation Website - Modern UI Revamp

## Project Goal

To transform the website's layout and aesthetics into a more modern, sophisticated, and youth-friendly design, addressing feedback that the current layout is awkward. The aim is to create a visually appealing and intuitive user experience.

## Key Design Principles for Revamp

*   **Clean and Minimalist**: Reduce visual clutter, focus on essential elements.
*   **Vibrant and Inviting Color Palette**: Use a modern color scheme that is appealing.
*   **Improved Typography**: Select fonts that are legible and contribute to a contemporary feel.
*   **Enhanced Interactivity**: Subtle hover effects, smooth transitions.
*   **Responsive and Adaptive**: Ensure the design looks great on all screen sizes.
*   **Better Spacing and Visual Hierarchy**: Optimize margins, paddings, and element sizing for better balance.

## Proposed Design Direction: "Vibrant Minimalism with Playful Accents"

*   **Color Palette**: A modern, vibrant, yet harmonious color scheme for both light and dark modes. A main accent color (e.g., a lively purple or teal) will be chosen, complemented by softer tones and stark contrasts for text.
*   **Typography**: Clean, contemporary sans-serif font ('Pretendard') with varied weights for clear visual hierarchy. Bold headings, readable body text.
*   **Layout**: Generous whitespace. Clean, card-like design for main content containers with subtle shadows and rounded corners.
*   **Interaction & Animation**: Subtle hover effects on buttons and navigation links. Smooth reveal animation for menu recommendation display.
*   **UI Elements**:
    *   **Buttons**: Modern, slightly rounded buttons with subtle gradient backgrounds for primary actions, solid fills for secondary actions (category buttons). Enhanced hover states.
    *   **Navigation**: Sleek, sticky header with clear navigation links and subtle underline animation on hover.
    *   **Dark Mode Toggle**: Visually integrated and functional.

## Plan

1.  **Update `style.css`**:
    *   **Color Palette**: Implement the new color variables for both light and dark modes.
    *   **Typography**: Apply the 'Pretendard' font and adjust font properties across the site.
    *   **General Layout & Spacing**: Refine `body`, `main-content` layout, and element spacing.
    *   **Header & Navigation**: Redesign to be sleeker with hover animations.
    *   **Container**: Apply new card-like design (softer shadows, rounded corners).
    *   **Buttons**: Implement new styles for `recommendBtn` and `category-btn` with gradients and improved hover effects.
    *   **Dark Mode Toggle**: Ensure integration.
    *   **Responsive Adjustments**: Review and refine media queries.

2.  **Review HTML Files**:
    *   Check `index.html`, `about.html`, `contact.html`, `privacy.html` for any minor structural adjustments needed to fully leverage the new CSS.

3.  **Commit and Push**: Upload all design changes to the GitHub repository.
